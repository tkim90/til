When serving assets to your website, the file type matters.

A PNG can be smaller than a JPEG, but only if you use it for the correct use case.

Use PNG if the asset is a chart, logo, or anything with transparent background.
Use JPEG if it's a picture.
Use GIF if it's an animation.

Each file type is optimized for their use case. Mixing them up will cause the file size to be larger than it should be.
