Both `web service` and `http` are a way for computers to communicate.

# Web Service
Helps two `machines` communicate `over a network`.
Any service that uses SOAP implementation.
Uses XML as the payload format.
"A Web service is merely an API wrapped in HTTP" (https://medium.com/@programmerasi/difference-between-api-and-web-service-73c873573c9d)

# HTTP
Helps two `applications` communicate `over a network`, which might or might not be different machines.
Any service that uses HTTP implementation. 
Uses JSON as the payload format.
APIs use HTTP, which is not always web based (example: App A using API from App B, but both sit in the same machine).
