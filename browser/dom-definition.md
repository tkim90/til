# What is a DOM?
It seems silly but it took me a while to grasp what a DOM is.

The "High Performance Javascript" book finally helped me picture it better:
A DOM is a language-independent API to access XML and HTML documents. 

In other words, it's a way for humans to access stuff inside an HTML document, like body, div, and p.

APIs:
`document.getElementsByClassName()`
`document.getElementsByTagName()`
`document.getElementsByName()`
`document.links`
`document.forms`
`document.images`
