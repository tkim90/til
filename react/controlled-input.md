# A `controlled input` is a coding pattern in react where you have complete control over the input's state, value, and `onChange` events.

React docs:
In HTML, form elements such as <input>, <textarea>, and <select> typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState().

It's good practice to use controlled components because React can keep these values in state, in a single source of truth. We _control_ what happens to the form's value and how it changes.

Class
```
constructor() {
  super();
  this.state = {
    search: '',
  }
}

onChangeHandler(event) {
  this.setState({ search: event.target.value });
}

render () {
  <input 
    type='text'
    onChange={this.onChangeHandler.bind(this)}
  />
}

```

Hooks
```
const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');

// target is the `input` element, `value` is its contents
const onChangeHandler = event => {
  setInputValue(event.target.value);
}

<input
  type='text'
  value={inputValue}
  onChange={onChangeHandler}
/>
``` 


Controlled input
```
<input type='text' value='Hello'/>
```

Not a controlled input
```
<input type='text' />
```
